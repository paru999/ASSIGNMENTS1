<h1>COMPUTER</h1>
	<h3><u><a href="">GO TO TOP</a></u></h3
		<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically</p>
	<h4><a name="CPU">CPU</a></h4>
		<p>A central processing unit is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output operations specified by the instructions</p>
	<h4><a name="ALU">ALU</a></h4>
		<p>An arithmetic logic unit is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit, which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units.</p>
<h2>PROGAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
	<h3><a name="C">C</a></h3>
		<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p>
	<h3><a name="C++">C++</a></h3>
		<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
<h2>DBMS</h2>
	<h4><a name="RDBMS">RDBMS</a></h4>
		<P>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database. Most commercial RDBMS's use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database, although SQL was invented after the development.
	<h4><a name="OODBMS">OODBMS</a></h4>
		<p>An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.</p>
	<h4><a name="HDBMS">HDBMS</a></h4>
		<P>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS), sometimes shortened to ODBMS for object database management system), is a database management system (DBMS) that supports the modelling and creation of data as objects.</P>
	<h4><a name="NWDBMS">NWDBMS</a></h4>
		<P>A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.</P>
